# GitTensor

GitTensor is a decentralized GitHub-equivalent built as a subnet on the [BitTensor](https://bittensor.com) network. It allows developers to host, push, pull, and merge Git repositories in a fully decentralized, incentivized, and fault-tolerant manner â€” powered by miners and validators.

Built for the next generation of open-source collaboration, GitTensor removes central intermediaries while preserving the familiar workflows of GitHub.
