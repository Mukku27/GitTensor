# GitTensor

GitTensor is a decentralized GitHub-equivalent built as a subnet on the [BitTensor](https://bittensor.com) network. It allows developers to host, push, pull, and merge Git repositories in a fully decentralized, incentivized, and fault-tolerant manner — powered by miners and validators.

Built for the next generation of open-source collaboration, GitTensor removes central intermediaries while preserving the familiar workflows of GitHub.

## 📌 Project Overview

**GitTensor** enables developers to interact with Git repositories via a decentralized protocol:

* **Validators** act as API/UI gateways and orchestrators.
* **Miners** store and serve Git repositories and execute Git actions.
* **Users** interact via CLI or UI (push, pull, merge, CI) with Validators, who assign tasks to Miners.

All actions are validated, replicated, and incentivized using BitTensor’s native TAO token.

---

## 🏗 Architecture

### 🔄 Data Flow

```text
User/API/UI → Validator → Miner(s) → Validator → User
```

1. **User/API** submits a request (e.g., push a repo).
2. **Validator** parses the request and validates it.
3. Validator delegates the task to one or more **Miners**.
4. Miners perform the requested Git operation.
5. Result is verified and acknowledged back to the Validator and then to the User.
6. Miners and Validators are rewarded upon successful execution.

### 🎭 Roles

* **Validator**

  * Serves API/UI endpoints
  * Parses and routes Git operations
  * Verifies miner performance
  * Maintains protocol rules and reputation scoring

* **Miner**

  * Hosts and maintains Git repositories
  * Executes Git commands (push, pull, merge)
  * Ensures redundancy through peer-to-peer replication
  * Verifies commits and updates

### 💰 Incentive Model

Miners and Validators earn TAO for:

* Successfully executed and verified Git actions
* Contributing to repository redundancy and uptime
* Honest protocol participation

## 🔑 Key Features

* ✅ Fully Decentralized Git Hosting
* 🔄 Peer-to-Peer Replication of Git Objects
* 🛠 Decentralized CI/CD Hooks (Coming Soon)
* 🧠 Validator-Guided Git Operations
* 🔐 Zero-Trust, Verifiable Task Execution
* 🪙 Native TAO Incentivization

---

## 🧪 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python ≥ 3.10
* Docker (optional for containerized deployment)
* BitTensor wallet (for TAO incentives)

### 2. Deploying a Miner

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitTensor/miner.git
cd miner
pip install -r requirements.txt
python miner.py --wallet.name <your_wallet>
```

Miners will register with the subnet and begin accepting Git tasks.

### 3. Deploying a Validator

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitTensor/validator.git
cd validator
pip install -r requirements.txt
python validator.py --wallet.name <your_wallet>
```

Validators expose endpoints (API/UI) for users and route tasks to miners.

### 4. Interacting via API/UI

Visit: `http://localhost:8000` (or deployed endpoint)

Or use CLI:

```bash
gittensor push --repo my-repo --remote validator_url
gittensor pull --repo my-repo --remote validator_url
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Usage Examples

### 🌀 Push to a GitTensor Repo

```bash
gittensor init
gittensor remote add origin gittensor://<repo-id>@<validator-address>
gittensor add .
gittensor commit -m "Initial commit"
gittensor push origin main
```

### ⬇ Pull from GitTensor

```bash
gittensor clone gittensor://<repo-id>@<validator-address>
```

### 🔃 Merge a Branch

```bash
gittensor checkout feature-x
gittensor merge main
gittensor push origin feature-x
```

## 🎯 Incentives & Rewards

### Miner Rewards

* Earn TAO for:

  * Hosting Git repos
  * Executing Git actions
  * Ensuring data availability and consistency

### Validator Rewards

* Earn TAO for:

  * Routing and verifying actions
  * Maintaining availability
  * Scoring and incentivizing honest miners

Incentives are distributed via the BitTensor staking and metagraph protocol.

---

## 🛡 Security & Redundancy

* **Merkle Tree Verification** for commit integrity
* **Peer Replication** across multiple miners
* **Validator Redundancy** and failure detection
* **Zero-Trust Execution** – Validators verify task integrity without assuming trust
